## 🎓 UNDERSTANDING THE RESEARCH ANGLE

**Why Emphasize Research?**

1. **Credibility:** Academic partnership elevates perception
2. **Funding:** Grants available for research (NSF, NIH, foundations)
3. **Timeline:** Research moves slower—sets proper expectations
4. **Outcomes:** Publications = shareable value beyond just project delivery
5. **Scale:** Research frameworks are designed to scale across contexts
6. **Sustainability:** Peer-reviewed work creates lasting impact

**How to Communicate It:**

- Lead with research questions (not just tasks)
- Emphasize validation and testing (not just implementation)
- Highlight publication opportunity (not just deliverables)
- Show user-centered methodology (not just technical excellence)
- Frame accessibility as research mission (not just feature)
