## Copy Philosophy

The updated copy maintains the research-partnership positioning while introducing audio protection as a key concern alongside accessibility. This creates a more complete value proposition:

- **Protection:** Safeguarding audio quality, security, and integrity
- **Accessibility:** Ensuring audio is usable for all people, regardless of ability
- **Research:** Studying and validating how protection and accessibility work together
- **Implementation:** Making it real-world deployable

This framing shows ArtyShield LUFS Audio as understanding that good audio design requires BOTH protection and accessibility—they're not trade-offs but complementary goals.
