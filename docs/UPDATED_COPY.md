## COPY TONE & VOICE

When using this copy, maintain these principles:

**DO:**
✓ Emphasize research + implementation partnership
✓ Lead with accessibility as core mission
✓ Quantify impact when possible (18% retention, 70k+ users)
✓ Show evidence of rigor (IRCAM training, Hans Zimmer background)
✓ Frame as "together we can" not "I can"
✓ Talk about scaling and sustainability
✓ Highlight publication/peer-review opportunities

**DON'T:**
✗ Oversell capabilities
✗ Use overly technical language in business slides
✗ Focus only on services/pricing
✗ Sound like a vendor pitch
✗ Ignore academic context
✗ Make promises about outcomes that are uncertain
✗ Use River Walk events as primary example (save for later if needed)

---

## QUICK COPY SWAP

If you want to make MINIMAL changes, swap these three things:

**Change 1 - Slide 1 Title:**
FROM: `Daniel Ramirez | LUFS Audio`
TO: `LUFS Audio + ArtyShield Lab`

**Change 2 - Slide 1 Subtitle:**
FROM: `UX Sound Designer and Audio Dev`
TO: `Bridging Audio Research & Real-World Implementation`

**Change 3 - Slide 1 Mission:**
